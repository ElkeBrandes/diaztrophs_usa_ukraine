This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(knitr)
names<- c("variable", "acronym", "units", "description")

variable<- c("biomass yield", "harvest index" , "number of seeds" , "precipitation", "radiation", "maximum daily temperature", "soil nitrate", "nif abundance", "nitrogenase activity") 

acronym<- c("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9")
unit <- c("Mg ha-1", "-", "ha-1", "mm", "W m-2", "degrees C", "ppm", "no idea", "mMol h-1")
dic<- data.frame(variable, acronym, unit)
kable(dic)

```

units<- c()
  
  
  
  (grain/biomass)
  per hectare
